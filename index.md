# About
{: #about}

IBM Watson&trade; Compare and Comply on IBM cloud Private makes it possible to rapidly parse through governing documents to convert, identify, and classify important elements. Using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing, the service extracts elements including `party` (to whom the document refers), `nature` (type of element), and `category` (specific element class).

Compare and Comply is designed to provide:

 - Natural language understanding of contracts and regulatory documents
 - The ability to convert programmatic or scanned PDF documents, image files, and text files to annotated JSON
 - Identification of legal entities and categories that align with subject matter expertise

Compare and Comply brings together a functionally rich set of integrated, automated Watson APIs to input a document, an image file, or a text file to identify sections, lists (numbered and bulleted), footnotes, and tables, converting these items into a structured HTML format. Furthermore, classification of this structured format is annotated and output as JSON with labeled elements, types,  categories, and other information.

To get started with the service, see the [Getting started](/docs/services/compare-and-comply/getting-started.html) page.
