# About
{: #about}

{{site.data.keyword.cnc_long}} makes it possible to rapidly parse through governing documents to convert, identify, and classify important elements. Using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing, the service extracts elements including `party` (to whom the document refers), `nature` (type of element), and `category` (specific element class).

{{site.data.keyword.cnc_short}} is designed to provide:

 - Natural language understanding of contracts and regulatory documents
 - The ability to convert programmatic PDF to annotated JSON
 - Identification of legal entities and categories that align with subject matter expertise

{{site.data.keyword.cnc_short}} brings together a functionally rich set of integrated, automated Watson APIs to input a programmatic PDF to identify sections, lists (numbered and bulleted), footnotes, and tables, converting these items into a structured HTML format. Furthermore, classification of this structured format is annotated and output as JSON with labeled elements, types, and categories.
